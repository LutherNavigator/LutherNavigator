### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 12.19.0 and NPM 6.13.4](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/)
- [The Heroku Command Line Interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [TypeScript 4.0.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- HTML 5, CSS 3 (+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)), JavaScript (ES6)

### Cloning the Project

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/LutherNavigator/LutherNavigator.git
```

### Local Deployment

In order to build and run the application, run the following command:

```console
$ heroku local web
```

After the local deployment, the built application can be accessed at
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Testing

Several testing packages are used:

- [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for backend testing
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for frontend testing

For getting more help on running the tests, execute the following:

```console
$ python3 scripts/test.py -h
```

### Database

It is also possible to interface with the MySQL database. In order to achieve
this, run:

```console
$ python3 scripts/db.py
```

### Backend

Our backend is divided into routes and services. The routes handle the routing
and rendering. Routes will, if necessary, make use of the services. The
services make database queries. This is done using the NPM package
[mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql).

### Admin

It is also possible to change administrators from the terminal. In order to
get more help, run the following:

```console
$ python3 scripts/admin.py -h
```

### Frontend

No frontend frameworks are used. Everything is kept simple with the only
special thing being the NPM package
[express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) for HTML
rendering.

### Deployment

The application is deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). It can be found
at [luthernavigator.com](https://www.luthernavigator.com/).

### Documentation

Packages [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) and
[typedoc-neo-theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-neo-theme) are used
for generating the project code documentation. It includes annotations for
virtually all of the important functions, classes, declarations, etc.
Documentation can be generated by executing `npm run document`. For viewing the
documentation, open the file `docs/index.html`.

### Style Guide

The codebase is developed in a style-consistent manner. Black and Prettier are
used for formatting Python and CSS/HTML/TypeScript code respectively.

Commands:

- CSS/HTML/TypeScript: `prettier --write --print-width 79`
- Python: `black --line-length 79`

Variable and Function naming conventions:

- Python: `snake_case`
- TypeScript: `camelCase`

Import Statements

- Direct `import` statements first, followed by `from` imports
- Order: Standard Library, Related Third Party, Local (same order for `from`
  imports)
- At each level, separate imports with a newline and sort them alphabetically
