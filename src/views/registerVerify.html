      Success! Your account has been verified! Your account must now be
      approved by an administrator, but after that you will be able to log in
      and begin posting. We'll send you an email when your account has been
      approved.

    <p>
      Invalid verification code. This is likely because the link expired.
      Please <a href="/register">register again</a>, bearing in mind you have
      little time before the link in the email expires.
